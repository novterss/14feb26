## 🎀 Project Overview
This is a special surprise website I built from scratch for **Mornor's Valentine's Day**! 🚀  
It's not just a website; it's a digital collection of our memories, designed with a **"Deep Galaxy"** theme to represent our infinite love. The goal was to create something unique, interactive, and deeply personal.

## ✨ Key Features
-   **🔐 Security Gate**: Protected by a 6-digit passcode (our special date!) to keep our memories private.
-   **❓ Love Quiz**: A 3-step verification quiz with cute personal questions to prove it's really her.
-   **📊 Love Dashboard**: Real-time stats showing exactly how long we've been together (down to the second!) and a "Happiness Level" gauge.
-   **📸 Memory Timeline**: A scrollable journey through our best moments, styled like a floating photo album with romantic captions.
-   **🌌 Dynamic Atmosphere**: A mesmerizing animated galaxy background with **200+ twinkling stars** generated via JavaScript.
-   **🎵 Interactive Audio**: "Photograph" by Ed Sheeran plays in the background with a custom-built volume slider.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
| Category | Technology |
|----------|------------|
| **Structure** | HTML5 |
| **Styling** | CSS3 (Animations, Glassmorphism, Gradients) |

## 🧠 What I Learned
Building this project for her helped me understand:
1.  **CSS Animations**: How to make things float, glow, and twinkle (like the stars and hearts).
2.  **DOM Manipulation**: Using JavaScript to handle the passcode logic, quiz validation, and dynamic star generation.
3.  **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the surprise looks perfect on her mobile phone.
4.  **Deployment**: How to host a statically generated site on the web.
